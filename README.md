## Description 

This application is a JavaScript Quiz. 

The landing page has both a "Start Quiz" button and a button to see "Top Scores".

Once the quiz starts, a countdown timer also begins.

For every wrong answer, an additional 15 seconds is removed from the timer.

When the quiz is over, if you have a score greater than zero, you are asked to enter your initals to be included on a top score page.

You are then directed to the top score page where you can see your scores!

From this page you can reset the top score list if you wish and also return to the home page.

## Code Example
***UPDATE:
I was able to take the advice from the initial grader, review the lessons, and work with members of my cohort to unravel the quiz and complete the requirements.

Below are the pictures from the first submission.
-----------------
***ORIGINAL:
I had a lot of issues with this code initially I finally was able to populate all the fields separately, but I did a total git failure and didn't push up. 

I was unable to get back to where I was and each section now overlaps one or the other.

## Usage 

When up and running, this would be a great tool for creating study questions for review as they were studying each night. You could create one for each applicable class. With more skills, the questions could be randomized to ensure greatest challenge.


## Learning Points 
***UPDATE: I worked on the code to correct the issues.

-----------------------------------------------------
This was another project that utilized JavaScript. I learned from my last project to approach each part section by section. I did start off really well and was remembering to git commit regularly.  I created an array that initially loaded to my quiz screen and rotated throught the questions. I then added the high score page and tried to complete the hidden/visible styles on each section. Somewhere in there I both forgot to git commit and I tried to do too many things at once and lost control.

Frankly, I thought I had it because I did understand how to create each part, but I got cocky and forgot to follow best practices.

At the same time, I have to remind myself that just over two weeks ago I had zero experience with this kind of work. This application may not actually do everything that it is supposed to, but what I did create is not far from being useful. 

I look forward to learning more and then coming back to this when the cohort is over and debugging and refactoring my work.

I am also learning that I really enjoy the styling aspect of this work.

PS This will forever be the project I was working on when my son completed his Eagle Project.
